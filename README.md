# Smart Watch
A small and effective library that has some feature of a smart watch.  
-> Fetches time from the DS1306 RTC module and updates it into the data structure  
-> Displays the time and date onto the oled (128*32) display.  
-> User can set/change the time and date according to their needs  
-> Alarm data structure that sends an alarm when then the alarm time matches the current time  
-> 6 instances of the alarm structure, hence the user can create 6 alarms  
-> Snooze feature that delays the alarm by an offset of 5 minutes  
-> User can set the display to be always ON or always OFF  
-> Tilt sensor tells the controller if the device is tilted or not, the user can turn ON or OFF this feature  
-> Heart rate and SPO2 level sensor that displays the users levels  
-> On board Vibration motor installed to alert the user about the alarm, which can be toggeled ON or OFF
